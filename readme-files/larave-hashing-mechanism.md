Laravel uses a robust hashing mechanism for securely storing passwords and sensitive data. Under the hood, it leverages PHP's built-in `password_hash()` function, which implements the **Bcrypt** hashing algorithm by default. Bcrypt is widely regarded as a secure choice because it’s computationally intensive, includes a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks, and supports a configurable "cost" factor to adjust its strength as hardware improves.

In practice, Laravel’s hashing is handled through its `Hash` facade (located in the `Illuminate\Support\Facades\Hash` namespace). When you call `Hash::make($password)`, it uses `password_hash()` with the Bcrypt algorithm and a default cost of 10 (this cost can be tweaked in the configuration if needed). The resulting hash includes the algorithm identifier, cost factor, salt, and the hashed value—all bundled into a single string.

For example, if you hash a password like "mysecretpassword", the output might look something like this:
```
$2y$10$some.random.salt.and.hash
```
Here, `$2y$` indicates Bcrypt, `10` is the cost, and the rest combines the salt and hash.

Laravel also provides `Hash::check($plainText, $hashedValue)` to verify passwords, which uses PHP’s `password_verify()` function to securely compare the plain-text input against the stored hash without exposing the original value.

If you’re curious about alternatives, Laravel’s hashing system can be configured to use other algorithms like Argon2i or Argon2id (available in PHP 7.2+), but you’d need to adjust the `config/hashing.php` file to switch from the default Bcrypt setup. Most folks stick with Bcrypt because it’s battle-tested and strikes a good balance between security and performance.
